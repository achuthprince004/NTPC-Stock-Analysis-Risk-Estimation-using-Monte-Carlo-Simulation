# 📊 NTPC Stock Analysis & Risk Estimation using Monte Carlo Simulation

This project focuses on analyzing NTPC Limited's stock performance using historical data and estimating potential future risks using Monte Carlo simulations. The goal is to understand the stock’s return behavior, visualize key metrics like moving averages, and quantify future uncertainty with Value at Risk (VaR).
